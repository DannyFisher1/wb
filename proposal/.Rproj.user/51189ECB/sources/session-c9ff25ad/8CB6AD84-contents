# Abstract
   This research project will attempt to identify the optimal configuration of a reusable water bottle targeted towards young adults aged 18 to 30. Reusable water bottles come in a range of sizes and configurations. Customers can choose options with different capacities, drinking interfaces, materials, levels of maintainability, and lid sizes. All of these attributes play a role in a person's decision on what reusable bottle to buy.

# Introduction

Reusable water bottles are eco-friendly alternatives to single-use plastic bottles, designed to reduce environmental impact and promote sustainable living. They are typically made from materials such as stainless steel, plastic, or glass, offering levels of durability and insulation. 
The rise in consumer awareness about environmental issues along with the materialistic facet of social media has fueled demand for these bottles in a practical and social context. Additionally, reusable water bottles come in a variety of designs, sizes, and colors to cater to diverse consumer preferences. 


According to an article published by the New York Times, reusable water bottle revenue from 2022 eclipsed 2 billion dollars in the USA alone(1). With the average reusable water bottle coming in at 30 dollars (2), this estimates that nearly 67 million reusable waters were sold as of 2022. With its annual growth rate projected to 4.3% a year (3), we can estimate a market cap of 2.37 billion dollars, or approximately 79 reusable million water bottles will be sold in 2025. 


# Market Opportunity
In observing current trends, our target audience will be young adults, particularly those between the ages of 18 and 30. We will be conducting a survey that will be distributed to students throughout campus. As we are using a product that many people already will use, our applicant pool is quite large. 


# Identify Competitors
The water bottle market is well developed with many players. Some of these brands are targeted towards young adults, with companies such as Hydro Flask, Stanley, and Swell all producing products that were the “trending” water bottle at some point in time. These competitors span in price from around twelve dollars to $60. Each brand has a different permutation of our identified attributes which can be seen in the table below. Through our survey and analysis we will predict an optimal water bottle, outperforming our identified competitors.

# Product Attributes & Research Questions

We believe the most important attributes are those that define the user experience with a reusable water bottle. The key physical features we aim to explore include capacity (measured in ounces), drinking interface options, materials, lid sizes, and ease of maintenance. Additionally, we are examining the price as an essential attribute of the product.

This leads us to the following research questions:

RQ1) What combination of attribute configurations will result in the highest potential sales?

RQ2) What value do customers place on different attributes?
