Make sure you update the settings in the YAML for your report. 

Use [markdown](https://commonmark.org/help/) for formatting, e.g.: **Bold**, _Italic_, etc.

Make a bullet list like this: 

- Item 1
- Item 2
- Item 3

Or a nubmered list like this: 

1. Item 1
2. Item 2
3. Item 3

If you want to insert an image in the `images` folder, you can insert it using html code like this: 

<center>
<img src="images/madd_logo.png" width=150>
</center>

The code `<center>` and `</center>` just puts the image in the center of the page, the `src=""` part defines the path to the image, and the `width=300` part defines the image width in pixels - use that to adjust the image size in your report.

Here are some section headers to use: 

# Abstract
